<div class="textblock"><p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Our team will be completing a compiler for a new programming language that we are creating.&#160; Individually, we have never taken a formal course in compilers or computation.&#160; However, we think such a project would be an ideal way to combine all the different topics we have learned at Oregon State University into a single deliverable.</p>
<p><b>User Perspective</b></p>
<p>Users new to compilers will find the field to be large and complex.&#160; We would like to simplify their first exposure and make it easier for learners to see the different parts in action.&#160; The OSU Learning Language, hereafter called OLL, is a simple language with a small learning curve.&#160; The source code should be reminiscent of C and therefore familiar to many developers.&#160; Each part of the compilation process will have a distinct component available for dissection and study with sample inputs and outputs.&#160; Each stage, as well as the overall project, will be well-documented.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p><b>Client</b></p>
<p>Our instructor and the teaching assistant will be considered our clients for this project.&#160; The client requirements will be those listed in this document, the syllabus, and any approved changes to the documentation that may occur over the term.</p>
<p><b>Software Structure</b></p>
<p>A compiler is composed of a front-end, a middle-end, and a back-end.&#160; The middle-end is focused on optimization and is outside the scope of this project.&#160; The majority of our work will target the front-end:&#160; taking the source code of a language into an abstract syntax tree.&#160; The back-end will be addressed sufficiently to have programs execute but will not be fully built out with our own code.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>The OLL will be compiled using the OSU Learning Compiler (OLC). Based on our preliminary research to this point, it is typical to break down the implementation of a new language and related compiler into the following modules:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lexer module - that would scan the original source code and convert it to a list of tokens. It would also report any error condition when detecting some invalid tokens.</li>
<li>Parser module - taking as input a list of tokens produced by the lexer, this module will build an abstract syntax tree representation (AST) of the source code. It will also detect and report any syntax errors.</li>
<li>Transpiler module - using AST code representation, produces equivalent source code in some common programming language. Such transpiled code could be compiled / executed using the tools / runtime associated with the target language. Our goal is to transpile to a high-level language that has support for classes and automatic memory management. Current considerations are Python or JavaScript.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Libraries, Languages, APIs, and Development Tools</b></p>
<p>Python 3.6.8 will be our primary language for this project, with the built-in unittest library for writing tests. We like Python for this project because we're all familiar with the language and it will allow us to iterate quickly during the accelerated quarter.</p>
<p>We discussed using third-party tools such as Flex to generate the lexer and Bison to generate the parser.&#160; However, we believe there will be a better learning experience to build a hands-on implementation from scratch. Currently. we don't have any intention of using third-party tools or APIs.&#160; We anticipate this may change for building out the back-end of the compiler if the requirements flex due to time constraints.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>The project will be linted using Flake8 and maintained with Continuous Integration via GitHub Actions, mandatory code review, and branch protection on the main branch. </p>
